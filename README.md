# Rails with React

I take no credit for this. This code was from Fernando Villalobos, following his tutorial on how React works with a Rails app.
You can follow and read through the tutorial at https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers

* NOTE
I did find an issue at the very end of the tutorial.
It should be 
ReactDOM.findDOMNode()
NOT
React.findDOMNode()
It drove me insane when I was following along and I could not get it to work.
